## Topic

Study Human-specific genes in Acute Lymphoid Leukemia

## Abstract 

The term 'human-specific gene' highlights a set of genes that characterize us as humans and cannot be found in our closest relatives, the chimpanzees. The role of human-specific (HS) genes is yet to be completely discovered and understood. Several studies have been carried out to identify and extend the list of known human-specific genes, with the final objective of understanding their linkage with human diseases. This study tries to extend our knowledge of human-specific genes regarding Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) by investigating the associations between HS genes and ALL using quantitative methodologies such as machine learning-based approaches and network gene expansions.
